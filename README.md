Creative Oasis is a modern, responsive digital agency website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project replicates a provided large-screen (LG) layout for card sizes and spacing, while introducing a completely original color palette, custom SM and MD breakpoints, and themed content focused on creativity and innovation. It features dynamic service cards, a filterable portfolio section, and team profiles, all optimized for accessibility and performance. Designed with a vibrant palette—Ocean Blue for trust, Coral Red for energy, and Gold Yellow for premium feel—the site uses a utility-first styling approach, responsive grid layouts, and smooth UI animations to ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.
